# Run tests
clarinet test
```

### Usage Examples

```clarity
;; Initialize user security profile
(contract-call? .stacksvault-security initialize-user-profile tx-sender true)

;; Create yield strategy
(contract-call? .stacksvault-defi create-advanced-yield-strategy 
    "Multi-Asset Yield Farm"
    (list "STX" "USDA" "sBTC")
    u1200  ;; 12% target APY
    u250   ;; 2.5% management fee
    u3     ;; Medium risk
    true   ;; Auto-compound enabled
)

;; Deposit with leverage
(contract-call? .stacksvault-defi deposit-with-leverage
